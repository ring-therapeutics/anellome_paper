# Anello Diversity Manuscript Repository
Repository containing code and auxillary files required to reproduce the
analysis from the anello diversity manuscript.

## Pre-Requisites
_Include instructions on what are needed to run all these analysis. Going
to aim to have a docker container to make this all easier if possible_

## Scripts
Analysis scripts have been organized under the following buckets. A list
